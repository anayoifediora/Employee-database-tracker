# Employee-database-tracker

## Project Description
The objective of this project was to develop a Command-Line Application that manages the database of all employees of an organization or business. It is imperative as a business owner to have an application that manages employee database and have functionalities to view employee records. view department records, add new employees, create new departments e.t.c. This will make managing the business a lot easier and ensures the business owner spends more time trying to increase profitability.

The project was developed using *Node.JS* and *mySQL* and also incorporated code libraries such as *Inquirer*, *mysql2* e.t.c. The application runs on the Command-Line interface and is initialized by typing the command `node server.js`. When the application is initiated, the user is prompted for input depending on the particular task the user wants to undertake. 

Working on this project exposed me to several new concepts especially the significance of mySQL. I learnt how to apply the concepts of **mySQL**, **Prepared Statements** and **CRUD**.
